fix links. delete does not follow links (just deletes links not files). copy walkFileTree had to not traverse links if you said to not follow links too. open terminals for all files selected to parent folder. change watchDir again. added a thread to trigger search afterwards if needed. got rid of many static vars and methods for find. move find fileVisitor to its own class. do not watchDir if in search mode list.
